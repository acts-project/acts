/// On construction, the input volumes are modified so that
/// they are connected in z and r and have synchronized bounds.
/// The way this is done can be configured using an *attachment*
/// and a *resize* strategy. Depending on the configuration,
/// the input volumes are either extended or gap volumes are created.
///
/// @note The volumes are never shrunk, because this would potentially
///       result in overlaps of the resulting volumes bounds.
