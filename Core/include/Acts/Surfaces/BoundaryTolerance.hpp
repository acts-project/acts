/// @brief Variant-like type to capture different types of boundary tolerances
///
/// Since our track hypothesis comes with uncertainties, we sometimes need to
/// check if the track is not just within the boundary of the surface but also
/// within a certain tolerance. This class captures different parameterizations
/// of such tolerances. The surface class will then use these tolerances to
/// check if a ray is within the boundary+tolerance of the surface.
///
/// Different types of boundary tolerances implemented:
/// - Infinite: Infinite tolerance i.e. no boundary check will be performed.
/// - None: No tolerance i.e. exact boundary check will be performed.
/// - AbsoluteBound: Absolute tolerance in bound coordinates.
///   The tolerance is defined as a pair of absolute values for the bound
///   coordinates. Only if both coordinates are within the tolerance, the
///   boundary check is considered as passed.
/// - AbsoluteCartesian: Absolute tolerance in Cartesian coordinates.
///   The tolerance is defined as a pair of absolute values for the Cartesian
///   coordinates. The transformation to Cartesian coordinates can be done via
///   the Jacobian for small distances. Only if both coordinates are within
///   the tolerance, the boundary check is considered as passed.
/// - AbsoluteEuclidean: Absolute tolerance in Euclidean distance.
///   The tolerance is defined as a single absolute value for the Euclidean
///   distance. The Euclidean distance can be calculated via the local bound
///   Jacobian and the bound coordinate residual. If the distance is within
///   the tolerance, the boundary check is considered as passed.
/// - Chi2Bound: Chi2 tolerance in bound coordinates.
///   The tolerance is defined as a maximum chi2 value and a weight matrix,
///   which is the inverse of the bound covariance matrix. The chi2 value is
///   calculated from the bound coordinates residual and the weight matrix.
///   If the chi2 value is below the maximum chi2 value, the boundary check
///   is considered as passed.
///
/// The bound coordinates residual is defined as the difference between the
/// point checked and the closest point on the boundary. The Jacobian is the
/// derivative of the bound coordinates with respect to the Cartesian
/// coordinates.
