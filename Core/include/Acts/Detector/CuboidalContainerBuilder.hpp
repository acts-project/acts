///
/// It relies on the detailed implementation of the CuboidDetectorHelper
/// and allows for DetectorVolume attachment in x/y/z
///
/// There exists an option to create this container builder (recursively)
/// from a blueprint tree, which attempts to fill in the gap volumes
/// accordingly.
///
/// @note the builder expects a fully consistent set of sub volume builders
/// that will be executed in a chain
///
/// @note allowed AxisDirection(s) for the cuboid container builder are
/// {AxisX}, {AxisY}, {AxisZ}.
///
/// @note Connecting containers isn't functional yet due to the underlying
/// issues in the CuboidDetectorHelper
