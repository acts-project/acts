/// @brief Helper class to calculate the residual between a straight line and
///        a CompositeSpacePoint measurement as well as the partial derivatives.
///        The residual is expressed as a 3D vector, where first two components
///        describe the spatial residual w.r.t. the precision & non-precision
///        direction, and the last one expresses the residual between the
///        parametrized time of arrival of the track and the measurement's
///        recorded time.
///
///        For straw type measurements, the precision residual is calculated as
///        the difference between the signed line distance between straw wire &
///        line, and the signed drift radius where the sign simply encodes the
///        left/right amibiguity. If the measurement additionally carries
///        information about the passage along the wire, the non-precision
///        residual is then defined to be the distance along the wire.
///
///        For strip type measurements, the residual is the distance in the
///        strip-readout plane between the point along the line that intersects
///        the plane spanned by the measurement.
///
///        If the strip measurements provide also the time of their record, the
///        residual calculation can be extended to the time of arrival parameter
///        The residual is then defined as the strip's recorded time minus the
///        time of flight of a particle on a straight line minus the time
///        offset.
///
///        Straw measurements are indirectly influenced by the time offset
///        parameter. The primary electrons produced by the traversing ionizing
///        particle drift towards the central straw wire. The drift time can be
///        directly mapped to the drift radius during the calibration procedure
///        where the rt relation and its first two derivatives are known
///        apprxomately. Further, it's assumed that the chip records are
///        composed timestamp that includes the drift time & the time of flight
///        of the ionizing particle. An update of the point of closest approach
///        leads to an indirect update of the drift radius and hence additional
///        terms need to be considered when calculating the residual's
///        derivatives.
