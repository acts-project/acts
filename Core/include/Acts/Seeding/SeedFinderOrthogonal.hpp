   * @brief Perform seed finding, appending seeds to a container.
   *
   * This method performs seed finding through an orthogonal range search
   * strategy. This strategy differs from binning approaches because it selects
   * seeds _constructively_ rather than _destructively_; instead of trying a
   * large number of possible space point combinations and then rejecting many
   * of them, this algorithm tries to only consider valid seed candidates to
   * reduce combinatorics.
   *
   * In addition, this algorithm replaces the binning step used in other seed
   * finding algorithms with the construction of a k-d tree, which allows us to
   * efficiently search for space points within a given range.
   *
   * The core idea behind this algorithm is to create axis-aligned bounding
   * boxes around the region of validity for a seed candidate (be it a bottom
   * spacepoint for a given middle, a top for a given middle, a middle for a
   * given bottom, or any other combination), and then searching the detector
   * volume for points that lie inside that AABB.
   *
   * @tparam input_container_t The type of the input spacepoint container.
   * @tparam output_container_t The type of the output seed container.
