/// @brief A class that helps in processing the neighbours, given a collection of
/// middle space points
/// The idea here is that in the seeding we look for compatible b-m and m-t
/// doublets. One of the requirements is that the bottom/top space point is at a
/// suitable distance (in radius) w.r.t. the middle space point. We know however
/// that the space points in each bin are sorted in radius. That means we can
/// use this sorting in order to reduce the number of space point to consider
/// when looking for compatible doublets.
/// The idea is to keep track of first space point that is in the allowed bin,
/// by storing its position using an iterator itr This helps us since the lower
/// possible buondary is given by the first middle space point (its radius minus
/// the mad deltaR defined by the user). The subsequent middle space point will
/// have a higher radius. That means that there is no point in looking at
/// neighbour space point before itr, since we know they will be out of range.
