/// ScopedTimer provides automatic timing of code blocks using RAII principles.
/// It starts timing when constructed and automatically logs the duration when
/// destroyed. This makes it ideal for measuring execution time of functions
/// or code blocks without manual start/stop calls.
///
/// Example usage:
/// @code
/// {
///   ScopedTimer timer("myFunction");
///   // ... code to measure ...
/// } // Timer automatically logs duration when block ends
/// @endcode
///
