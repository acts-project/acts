/// @brief A general implementation of an N dimensional DBScan clustering algorithm.
///
/// This is a general implementation of an N dimensional DBScan clustering
/// algorithm. The DBScan algorithm uses density information to cluster together
/// points that are close to each other.
///
/// For each point, we will look for the neighbours that are within the epsilon
/// radius. If the number of neighbours is greater than the minimum number of
/// points, we will start a new cluster and assign the current point to it. We
/// will then look for the neighbours of the neighbours and assign them to the
/// current cluster if they are not already assigned to a cluster. If the
/// neighbours have itself more than the minimum number of points as neighbours,
/// we will repeat the process on those neighbours.
///
/// To speed up the search for the neighbours, we use the KDTree implemented in
/// ACTS. It performs a range search in the orthogonal hypercube with a length
/// of 2 epsilon. An extra cut is used to only keep the neighbours that are
/// within the epsilon radius.
///
/// @tparam kDims The number of dimensions.
/// @tparam scalar_t The scalar type used to construct position vectors.
/// @tparam kLeafSize The maximum number of points in a leaf node of the KDTree.
