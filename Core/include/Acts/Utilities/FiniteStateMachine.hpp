namespace Acts {

/// Implementation of a finite state machine engine
///
/// Allows setting up a system of states and transitions between them. States
/// are definedd as empty structs (footprint: 1 byte). Transitions call
/// functions using overload resolution. This works by subclassing this class,
/// providing the deriving type as the first template argument (CRTP) and
/// providing methods like
///
/// ```cpp
/// event_return on_event(const S&, const E&);
/// ```
///
/// The arguments are the state `S` and the triggered event `E`. Their values
/// can be discarded (you can attach values to events of course, if you like)
/// The return type of these functions is effectively `std::optional<State>`, so
/// you can either return `std::nullopt` to remain in the same state, or an
/// instance of another state. That state will then become active.
///
/// You can also define a method template, which will serve as a catch-all
/// handler (due to the fact that it will match any state/event combination):
///
/// ```cpp
/// template <typename State, typename Event>
///   event_return on_event(const State&, const Event&) const {
///   return Terminated{};
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If for a given state and event no suitable overload of `on_event` (and you
/// also haven't defined a catch-all as described above), a transition to
/// `Terminated` will be triggered. This is essentially equivalent to the method
/// template above.
///
/// If this triggers, it will switch to the `Terminated` state (which is always
/// included in the FSM).
///
/// Additionally, the FSM will attempt to call functions like
/// ```cpp
/// void on_enter(const State&);
/// void on_exit(const State&);
/// ```
/// when entering/exiting a state. This can be used to
/// perform actions regardless of the source or destination state in a
/// transition to a given state. This is also fired in case a transition to
/// `Terminated` occurs.
///
/// The base class also calls
/// ```cpp
/// void on_process(const Event&);
/// void on_process(const State&, const Event&);
/// void on_process(const State1& const Event&, const State2&);
/// ```
/// during event processing, and allow for things like event and
/// transition logging.
///
/// The `on_event`, `on_enter`, `on_exit` and `on_process` methods need to be
/// implemented exhaustively, i.e. for all state/event combinations. This might
/// require you to add catch-all no-op functions like
/// ```cpp
/// template <typename...Args>
/// event_return on_event(Args&&...args) {} // noop
/// ```
/// and so on.
///
/// The public interface for the user of the FSM are the
/// ```cpp
/// template <typename... Args>
/// void setState(StateVariant state, Args&&... args);
///
/// template <typename Event, typename... Args>
/// void dispatch(Event&& event, Args&&... args) {
/// ```
///
/// `setState` triggers a transition to a given state, `dispatch` triggers
/// processing on an event from the given state. Both will call the appropriate
/// `on_exit` and `on_enter` overloads. Both also accept an arbitrary number of
/// additional arguments that are passed to the `on_event`, `on_exit` and
/// `on_enter` overloads.

/// @tparam States Argument pack with the state types that the FSM can be
