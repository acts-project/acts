/// @defgroup subspace Linear subspace definitions
///
/// All types in this group define a linear subspace of a larger vector space
/// with the following properties: the subspace is defined by a set of axis
/// indices in the full space, i.e. there is no need for a non-trivial
/// projection matrix, all subspace axis indices are unique and there are no
/// duplicated ones, and the set of axis indices must be ordered, i.e. the axis
/// order in the subspace is the same as in the full space. The last requirement
/// is not strictly required by the implementation, but is still added to
/// simplify reasoning.
///
/// Only the size of the subspace are defined by the types at compile time.
/// Which axes comprise the subspace is defined at runtime. This allows to use
/// fixed-size computations (selected at compile time) but avoids the
/// combinatorial explosion of also having to handle all possible combination of
/// axes at compile time. This was tried previously and resulted in sizable
/// resource consumption at compile time without runtime benefits.
///
/// All types are intentionally using `size_t` as their template values, instead
/// of the more specific index enums, to reduce the number of templates. This is
/// fully compatible as the index enums are required to be convertible to
/// `size_t`.
///
/// All types intentionally only define the subspace but not how vectors
/// and matrices are stored to avoid unnecessary coupling between components,
/// i.e here between the pure definition and the storage.
///
/// All types provide `.projectVector(...)` and `.exandVector(...)` methods to
/// convert to/from the subspace. They also provide `.projector()` and
/// `.expander()` methods to create projection and expansion matrices if they
/// are required explicitly. For the specific subspace requirements listed
/// above, the projection and expansion matrices are transpose to each other. In
/// the general case, this does not have to be the case and users are encouraged
/// to use `.projector()` and `.expander()` instead of e.g.
/// `.projector().transpose()`.
