/// Optimized navigation policy for cylindrical volumes that intelligently
/// selects which portals to add as candidates based on geometric analysis.
///
/// This policy performs geometric calculations to determine which cylinder
/// faces (inner/outer cylinder, positive/negative discs) are reachable from
/// the current position and direction, avoiding unnecessary intersection
/// calculations with unreachable portals.
///
/// Algorithm overview:
/// 1. Transform position/direction to volume-local coordinates
/// 2. Check disc intersection: If not parallel to z-axis, calculate
///    intersection with appropriate disc (positive/negative based on
///    direction) and verify if intersection point lies within the annular disc
///    bounds
/// 3. Check inner cylinder intersection: Find point of closest approach to
///    the z-axis in the xy-plane. If this point is closer than inner radius
///    and lies within the forward ray direction, add inner cylinder as
///    candidate
/// 4. Optimization: If both inner cylinder and disc are hit, compare their 3D
///    distances along the ray. If the inner cylinder is closer, discard the
///    disc candidate as it will be blocked and never reached
/// 5. Default fallback: If neither disc nor inner cylinder are hit, add outer
///    cylinder as the target (particle will exit through outer boundary)
///
/// Constraints:
/// - Only works with cylindrical volumes having non-zero inner radius
/// - Requires exactly 4 portals (inner cylinder, outer cylinder, Â±z discs)
/// - Does not handle contained sub-volumes
///
/// Performance benefits:
/// - Reduces intersection calculations by ~2-3x compared to trying all portals
/// - Eliminates false positive intersections that would be filtered later
