/// accumulation and averaging for one surface bin. The accumulation procedure
/// is done in two steps:
///
/// 1.  The per-track store accumulates material steps from one track/particle.
///     Multiple material steps can be assigned to the same bin time by
///     one particle, e.g. if the simulation has created more than one step in
///     the material or if several components are compressed into one
///     description. Multiple steps are treated as if they are passed one after
///     the other.
/// 2.  The total store averages the accumulated material properties over all
///     tracks. Each track contributes equally.
