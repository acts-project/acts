/// The StepperExtensionList allows to add an arbitrary number of step
/// evaluation algorithms for the RKN4 evaluation. These can be categorised in
/// two general types:
/// a) Step evaluation that should not be evaluated along with other
/// extensions, or at least would overwrite partial results. This means that
/// in the best case unnecessary/redundant calculation would be performed, in
/// the worst case the evaluation would go wrong.
/// b) The step evaluation remains untouched and only further calculations are
/// performed (like additional features or data gathering) that can be treated
/// as independent of the basic step evaluation in type a). These types can be
/// added but do not require special treatment in order to not ruin the step
/// evaluation.
/// The concept of the auctioneers aims in the first place to judge which
/// extension of category a) is the one to go. Although every extension can
/// judge if it is valid based on the data given from the state of stepper,
/// multiple extensions from type a) could fulfill their dependencies. Since
/// an extension does not know about other extensions, the decision for the
/// best extension for the step can only be estimated on a global scope. This
/// is the job of the auctioneers.
///
/// TODO: An anticipation of an optimal concept of the input (and maybe also
/// the output) of the call operator of an auctioneer cannot be performed at
/// the current stage. At the current stage, a real bid-system would be pure
