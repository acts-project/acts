/// through the static tracking geometry setup.
///
/// The current navigation stage is cached in the state struct and updated
/// when necessary. If any surface in the extrapolation  flow is hit, it is
/// set to the propagation satate, such that other actors can deal wit it.
/// This navigation actor thus always needs to run first!
/// It does two things: it figures out the order of volumes, layers and
/// surfaces. For each propagation step, the operator() runs, which checks if
/// the current surface (or layer/volume boundary) is reached.
///
/// The current target surface is the surface pointed to by of the iterators
/// for the surfaces, layers or volume boundaries.
/// If a surface is found, the state.navigation.currentSurface
/// pointer is set. This  enables subsequent actors to react. Secondly, this
/// actor uses the ordered  iterators  to figure out which surface, layer or
/// volume boundary is _supposed_ to be hit next. It then sets the maximum
/// step size to the path length found out by straight line intersection. If
/// the state is not on surface, it also  re-computes the step size, to make
/// sure we end up at the desired surface.
