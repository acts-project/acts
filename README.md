Acts is an experiment-independent toolkit for (charged) particle track
reconstruction in (high energy) physics experiments implemented in modern C++.

More information can be found in the [Acts documentation](https://acts.readthedocs.io/).

## Quick start

Acts is developed in C++ and is build using [CMake](https://cmake.org). Building
the core library requires a C++20 compatible compiler,
[Boost](https://www.boost.org), and [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org). The
following commands will clone the repository, configure, and build the core
library

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acts-project/acts <source>
cmake -B <build> -S <source>
cmake --build <build>
```

For more details, e.g. specific versions and additional dependencies, have a
look at the [getting started guide](docs/getting_started.md). If you find a bug,
have a feature request, or want to contribute to Acts, have a look at the
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.rst).

## Versioning and public API

Release versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
to indicate whether a new version contains breaking changes within the public API.
Currently, only a limited part of the visible API is considered the public API
and subject to the semantic versioning rules. The details are outlined in the
[versioning and public API documentation](docs/versioning.rst).

## Repository organization

The repository contains all code of the Acts projects, not just the core library
that a physics experiment is expected to use as part of its reconstruction code.
All optional components are disabled by default. Please see the
[getting started guide](docs/getting_started.md) on how-to enable them.

-   `Core/` contains the core library that provides functionality in the `Acts`
    namespace.
-   `Plugins/` contains plugins for core functionality that requires
    additional external packages. The functionality also resides in the `Acts`
    namespace.
-   `Fatras/` provides fast track simulation tools based on the core
    library. This is not part of the core functionality and thus resides in the
    separate `ActsFatras` namespace.
-   `Examples/` contains simulation and reconstruction examples. These are
    internal tools for manual full-chain development and tests and reside in
    the `ActsExamples` namespace.
-   `Tests/` contains automated unit tests, integration tests, and
    (micro-)benchmarks.
-   `thirdparty/` contains external dependencies that are usually not available
    through the system package manager.
