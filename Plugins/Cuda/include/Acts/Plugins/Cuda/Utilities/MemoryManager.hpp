/// Singleton class used for allocating memory on CUDA device(s)

/// In order to avoid calling @c cudaMalloc(...) and @c cudaFree(...) too many
/// times in the code (which can turn out to be pretty slow), device memory
/// is allocated using this singleton memory manager for the
/// @c Acts::Cuda::device_array arrays.
///
/// It is implemented in a **very** simple way. It allocates a big blob of
/// memory, and then hands out pointers from this blob to anyone that asks for
/// device memory.
///
/// The class doesn't handle memory returns in any sophisticated way. It assumes
/// that any calculation will need all allocated memory until the end of that
/// calculation. At which point all of that memory gets re-purpused in one call.
///
/// The code is not thread safe currently in any shape or form. But there should
/// be ways of making it at least "thread friendly" later on.
