# This script runs a Geant4 simulation in parallel by passing chunks of events to subprocesses.
# This is a workaround to achieve parallel processing even though Geant4 is not thread-save
# and thus the internal parallelism of the ACTS examples framework cannot be used.
#
# Note that:
# ==========
#
# * This should give equivalent results to a sequential run if the RNG is initialized with
#   the same seed in all runs
#
# * So far this works only for csv outputs, since they write the results in one file per event
#   (the naming of the csv-files should be equivalent to a sequential run)
#
# * In principle it is not difficult to extend this for ROOT files as well. One would need to
#   write the root-files into seperate directory per chunk, and then use ROOT's hadd to combine
#   the output files.
