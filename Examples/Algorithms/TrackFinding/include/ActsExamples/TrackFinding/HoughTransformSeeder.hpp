// @brief Implements track-seeding using a Hough transform.
//
// Using the Lorentz force equation, one can relate the phi of a track and the
// coordinate of a single hit:
//
//      A * q / pT = sin(phi_track - phi_hit) / r
//
// where
//      A   : 3 * 10^-4 GeV / (c*mm*e) for the ATLAS B field (to be configured)
//      q   : charge of the particle
//      pT  : transverse momentum
//      r   : cylindrical radius of the hit from the beamline
//      phi : in radians
//
// Here, q/pT and phi_track (ie at phi at perigee) are unknown. This equation
// forms a line in q/pT vs phi_track spac since the sin function above can be
// approximated with sin(x) ~ x. Each hit will have its own line based on its
// position (phi and r). However, note that hits belonging to the same track
// will have lines that intersect at the track's q/pT and phi. In this manner,
// we can conduct pattern -matching by looking for intersections of these pT-phi
// lines.
//
// In other words, given some assumed q/pT for the track one can take the phi
// and r for a hit and convert that to what the phi(perigee) for a track must
// have been. We loop over the q/pT bins, and at the true value all the hits
// should line up in the same bin
//
// To easily find intersections, we first pixelate (equivalently, we make a 2d
// histogram from) the graph of all the hit's lines in q/pT vs phi_track space.
// We then apply a convolution (i.e. a scanning window) to pick out points with
// multiple lines going through them. These points become our seed.
//
// In principle the Hough transform can be used for an entire region (i.e. .2
// phi x .2 eta) or larger. However this can lead to an excessive number of
// hits/lines in the transform houghHist, leading to spurious intersections.
// Instead, we can use multiple transforms that each cover a slice in z0, and
// simply combine all the seeds found. These are the subregions
//

// We adopt the following nomenclature within this class:
//      houghHist: The 'graph' in q/pT vs phi_track space, filled with a line
//      calculated as above for each hit. point: A specific q/pT and phi_track
//      bin in the above houghHist; i.e. what is normally called a pixel
//             but I don't want to confuse this with the detector type. A
//             point's value is the number of lines that go through it.
//
// For the first iteration, x refers to phi_track, and y refers to q/pT,
// although this should remain flexible. These are set via the variables m_par_x
// and m_par_y.
//
// NOTE: y=0 represents the lowest q/pT bin, x=0 represents the lowest
// phi(perigee) bin
//      houghHist[y=0][x=0]      : lowest q/pT and lowest phi_track bin
//      houghHist[y=size-1][x=0] : highest q/pT and lowest phi_track bin
//
