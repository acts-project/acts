# Getting started

## Quick start

ACTS is developed in C++ and is built using [CMake](https://cmake.org). Building
the core library requires a C++20 compatible compiler,
[Boost](https://www.boost.org), and [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org). The
following commands will clone the repository, configure, and build the core
library:

```console
git clone https://github.com/acts-project/acts <source>
cmake -B <build> -S <source>
cmake --build <build>
```

For a full list of dependencies, including specific versions, see the
[Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section below. Build options to activate
additional components are described in the [Build options](#build-options)
section.

## Prerequisites

The following dependencies are required to build the ACTS core library:

- A C++17 compatible compiler (recent versions of either gcc and clang should work)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.14
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org) >= 1.71 with `filesystem`, `program_options`, and `unit_test_framework`
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) >= 3.3.7

The following dependencies are optional and are needed to build additional
components:

- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for the CUDA plugin and the Exa.TrkX plugin and its examples
- [DD4hep](http://dd4hep.cern.ch) >= 1.11 for the DD4hep plugin and some examples
- [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org) >= 1.8.15 for the documentation
- [Geant4](https://geant4.org/) for some examples
- [HepMC](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hepmc/HepMC3) >= 3.2.1 for some examples
- [Intel Threading Building Blocks](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) >= 2020.1 for the examples
- [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) >= 1.12.0 for the ONNX plugin, the Exa.TrkX plugin and some examples
- [Pythia8](https://pythia.org) for some examples
- [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) >= 6.20 for the ROOT plugin and the examples
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) >= 2.0 with [Breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Exhale](https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [recommonmark](https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) extensions for the documentation
- [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html) for the Exa.TrkX plugin
- [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) for the Python bindings of the examples
- [FastJet](http://fastjet.fr/) >= 3.4.0 for the FastJet plugin

There are some additional dependencies that are automatically provided as part of
the build system.
These are usually not available through the system package manager and can be found in the ``thirdparty`` directory.

All external dependencies must be provided prior to building ACTS. Compatible
versions of all dependencies are provided e.g. by the [LCG
releases](https://lcginfo.cern.ch/) starting from [LCG 102b](https://lcginfo.cern.ch/release/102b/).
For convenience, it is possible to build the required boost and eigen3 dependencies using the ACTS build system; see [Build options](#build-options).
Other options are also
available and are discussed in the [Building Acts](#building-acts) section.

[Profiling](contribution/profiling.md) details the prerequisites for profiling the ACTS project with gperftools.

## Building ACTS

ACTS uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) to configure, build, and install the
software. After checking out the repository code into a `<source>` directory,
CMake is called first to configure the build into a separate `<build>`
directory. A typical setup is to create a `<source>/build` directory within the
sources, but this is just a convention; not a requirement. The following command
runs the configuration and searches for the dependencies. The `<build>`
directory is automatically created.

```console
cmake -B <build> -S <source>
```

The build can be configured via various options that are listed in detail in the
[Build options](#build-options) section. Options are set on the command line.
The previous command could be e.g. modified to

```console
cmake -B <build> -S <source> -DACTS_BUILD_UNITTESTS=on -DACTS_BUILD_FATRAS=on
```

After the configuration succeeded, the software is build. This is also done with cmake via the following command

```console
cmake --build <build>
```

This automatically calls the configure build tool, e.g. Make or Ninja. To build only a specific target, the target names has to be separated from the CMake options by `--`, i.e.

```console
cmake --build <build> -- ActsFatras # to build the Fatras library
```

The build commands are the same regardless of where you are building the
software. Depending on your build environment, there are different ways how to
make the dependencies available.

### With a LCG release on CVMFS

If you have access to a machine running [CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/),
e.g. CERNs lxplus login machines, the dependencies can be easily satisfied
via an LCG releases available through CVMFS. Source the cvmfs setup script
provided by the machine. It is suggested to select a recent `<lcg_release>`
and `<lcg_platform>` combination. (Have a look at the CI jobs to get an
overview on what we are currently testing):

```console
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/<lcg_release>/<lcg_platform>/setup.sh
```

After sourcing the setup script, you can build ACTS as described above.

### In a container

A set of container images is available through the [ACTS container
registry][acts_containers]. The following containers are used as part of the
continuous integration setup and come with all dependencies pre-installed.

- `ubuntu2204`
- `ubuntu2404`

Furthermore, we are also testing on, but do not provide the corresponding containers:

- `alma9` (HEP-specific software from LCG 104 or 105 and gcc13 or clang16)
- `macOS-10.15`

:::{attention}
We stopped producing fully-contained LCG containers in favor of running LCG
based tests directly from CVMFS.
:::

To use these locally, you first need to pull the relevant images from the
registry. Stable versions are tagged as `vX` where `X` is the version number.
The latest, potentially unstable, version is tagged as `latest`. To list all
available tags, e.g. for the `ubuntu2004` image, you can use the following
command:

```console
docker search --list-tags ghcr.io/acts-project/ubuntu2404
```

The following command then downloads a stable tag of the `ubuntu2404` image:

```console
docker pull ghcr.io/acts-project/ubuntu2404:51
```

This should print the image id as part of the output. You can also find out the
image id by running `docker images` to list all your locally available container
images.

Now, you need to start a shell within the container to run the build. Assuming
that `<source>` is the path to your source checkout on your host machine, the
following command will make the source directory available as `/acts` in the
container and start an interactive `bash` shell

```console
docker run --volume=<source>:/acts:ro --interactive --tty <image> /bin/bash
```

where `<image>` is the image id that was previously mentioned. If you are using the Ubuntu-based image you are already good to go. For the images based on LCG releases, you can now activate the LCG release in the container shell by sourcing a setup script:

```console
container $ source /opt/lcg_view/setup.sh
```

Building ACTS follows the instructions above with `/acts` as the source directory, e.g.

```console
container $ cmake -B build -S /acts -DACTS_BUILD_FATRAS=on
container $ cmake --build build
```

### On your local machine

Building and running ACTS on your local machine is not officially supported.
However, if you have the necessary prerequisites installed it is possible to
use it locally. ACTS developers regularly use different Linux distributions and
macOS to build and develop ACTS. It is possible to use Spack to more easily
install ACTS' dependencies; see the [building with Spack](misc/spack.md) page for
more information.

## Building the documentation

The documentation uses [Doxygen][doxygen] to extract the source code
documentation and [Sphinx][sphinx] with the [Breathe][breathe] extension to
generate the documentation website. To build the documentation locally, you
need to have [Doxygen][doxygen] version `1.9.5` or newer installed.
[Sphinx][sphinx] and a few other dependencies can be installed using the Python
package manager `pip`:

```console
cd <source>
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

:::{tip}
It is **strongly recommended** to use a [virtual
environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for
this purpose! For example, run

```console
python -m venv docvenv
source docvenv/bin/activate
```

to create a local virtual environment, and then run the `pip` command above.
:::

To activate the documentation build targets, the `ACTS_BUILD_DOCS` option has to be set

```console
cmake -B <build> -S <source> -DACTS_BUILD_DOCS=on
```

Then the documentation can be build with this target

```console
cmake --build <build> --target docs
```

The default option includes the Doxygen, Sphinx, and the Breathe extension,
i.e. the source code information can be used in the manually written
documentation. An attempt is made to pull in symbols that are cross-referenced from
other parts of the documentation. This is not guaranteed to work: in case
of errors you will need to manually pull in symbols to be documented.

## Build options

CMake options can be set by adding `-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>` to the configuration
command. The following command would e.g. enable the unit tests

```console
cmake -B <build> -S <source> -DACTS_BUILD_UNITTESTS=ON
```

Multiple options can be given. `cmake` caches the options so that only changed
options must be specified in subsequent calls to configure the project. The
following options are available to configure the project and enable optional
components.

<!-- CMAKE_OPTS_END -->

All ACTS-specific options are disabled or empty by default and must be
specifically requested.

ACTS comes with a couple of CMakePresets which allow to collect and
origanize common configuration workflows. On the surface the current
list of presets contains:

- `dev` as a base for developer configurations. This enables everything
  necessary for running the ODD full chain examples with Fatras. It
  sets the cpp standard to 20, the generator to ninja and enables ccache.
- `perf` is similar to `dev` but tweaked for performance measurements.

In addition to the ACTS-specific options, many generic options are available
that modify various aspects of the build. The following options are some of the
most common ones. For more details, have a look at the annotated list of [useful
CMake variables](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/cmake/Useful-Variables) or at the [CMake
documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/).

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     | Build type, e.g. Debug or Release; affects compiler flags <br/> (if not specified **`RelWithDebInfo`** will be used as a default) |
| CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER   | Which C++ compiler to use, e.g. g++ or clang++                                                                                    |
| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX | Where to install ACTS to                                                                                                          |
| CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH    | Search path for external packages                                                                                                 |

The build is also affected by some environment variables. They can be set by prepending them to the configuration call:

```console
DD4hep_DIR=<path/to/dd4hep> cmake -B <build> -S <source>
```

The following environment variables might be useful.

| Environment variable | Description                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| DD4hep_DIR           | Search path for the DD4hep installation  |
| HepMC3_DIR           | Search path for the HepMC3 installation  |
| Pythia8_DIR          | Search path for the Pythia8 installation |

## The OpenDataDetector

ACTS comes packaged with a detector modeled using DD4hep that can be used to test your algorithms. It comes equipped with a magnetic field file as well as an already built material map.
It is available via the git submodule feature by performing the following steps ([`git lfs`](https://git-lfs.com/) need to be installed on your machine):

```console
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To use it, you will then need to build ACTS with the `ACTS_BUILD_ODD` option and then point either `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux or
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `DD4HEP_LIBRARY_PATH` on MacOs to the install path of the ODD factory (for example: `build/thirdparty/OpenDataDetector/factory`).

You can now use the ODD in the python binding by using:

```python
oddMaterialDeco = acts.IMaterialDecorator.fromFile("PATH_TO_Acts/thirdparty/OpenDataDetector/data/odd-material-maps.root")
detector = getOpenDataDetector(oddMaterialDeco)
trackingGeometry = detector.trackingGeometry()
decorators = detector.contextDecorators()
```

## Using ACTS

When using ACTS in your own CMake-based project, you need to include the
following lines in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
find_package (Acts COMPONENTS comp1 comp2 ...)
```

where `compX` are the required components from the ACTS project. See the
`cmake` output for more information about which components are available.
