## Description
In this white paper we derive
\begin{itemize}
    \item the 4x4 covariance matrix of the vertex position,
    \item the 4x3 cross-covariance matrix between the vertex position and the $i$-th particle momentum,
    \item and the 3x3 cross-covariance matrix between the $i$-th and the $j$-th particle momentum.
\end{itemize}
