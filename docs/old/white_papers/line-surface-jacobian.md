## Description
Line surface used for wire measurements or perigee surface is an unique type of surface where the intersections of a track is not defined on a physical plane. Due to this trait, the underlying mathematics gets quite complicated especially with coordinate transform jacobian whose reference was missing in the source code. (Please let the authors know if anyone finds it). In this white paper, thus we attempt to derive the jacobians for both local-to-global and global-to-local transforms.
