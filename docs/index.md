# Introduction

ACTS is an experiment-independent toolkit for (charged) particle track
reconstruction in (high energy) physics experiments implemented in modern C++.

The ACTS project provides high-level track reconstruction modules that can be
used for any tracking detector. The tracking detector geometry description is
optimized for efficient navigation and fast extrapolation of tracks. Converters
for several common geometry description packages are available. In addition to
the algorithmic code, this project also provides an event data model for the
description of track parameters and measurements.
