@page physmon Physics Monitoring in CI
@brief Monitoring physics performance in the ACTS CI

The ACTS CI runs a suite of physics performance monitoring jobs dubbed
*physmon*. The purpose is to monitor and detect changes in the physics
performance, both intentional and accidental.

The associated job will run a number of workflow combinations. Currently, this
includes the truth tracking and OpenDataDetector *full chain* workflows. The
latter is further split into configurations with full seeding, truth smeared or
truth estimated seeds. These jobs produce performance output files.

These performance output files are then evaluated using the programs dubbed
[](analysis_apps). After this step, the job will then run comparisons of the
diagnostics histograms created by these programs. If the comparisons indicate
that the histogram contents changed meaningfully, the job will fail and report
this on a pull request.

## How do I investigate a physmon failure?

The physmon CI job attaches its results as an artifact to the CI run (also for successful runs)
From your pull request, you need to click on the *Checks* tab at the top:

![Checks button on GitHub](physmon/physmon_checks.png)

From there, click on the *Builds* workflow on the left:

![Builds runs the physmon job](physmon/physmon_run.png)

On the workflow overview, scroll down to find the attached artifacts, and locate the *physmon* artifact. You can click to download it:

![physmon artifact](physmon/physmon_artifact.png) {width=100%}

> [!note]
> GitHub Actions artifacts are deleted after a fixed amount of time. If the CI
> completed a while ago, it is possible this report is no longer available.

After the download, you need to unzip the archive, whose contents will look similar to this:

```

ckf_seeded_plots
ckf_truth_estimated.html

```

The `.root` files are the performance output files and corresponding histogram
files. The physmon job log file is also available. Finally, the `_plots` folder
contain plots of all the histogram comparisons, and the `.html` files contain
single-file reports showing the detailed results. An example of an HTML report
looks like this:

![Physmon report](physmon/physmon_report.png) {width=100%}

If you get a physmon job failure on your pull request, please investigate the
failing report(s), and try to understand if the change causing the
discrepancies is expected.

In case the conclusion is that the changes are indeed expected, the reference
files used to generate the comparisons are located in `CI/physmon/reference/`,
and can be updated to the output files found in the artifact zip archive.
