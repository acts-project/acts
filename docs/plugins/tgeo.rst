TGeo plugin
===========

General
-------

The ``TGeo`` plugin connects a geometry described with the ``ROOT::Geom`` module with Acts. This is done by parsing the ROOT geometry and selecting ``TGeoNode`` objects that represent chosen geometrical objects. 
Acts detector elements are represented by surfaces with dedicated shapes, hence a conversion of the volume based ``TGeoNode`` description into ``Acts::Surface`` objects needs to take place.

An example use of the ``TGeo`` plugin can be found in the ``TGeoDetector`` example.

Parsing the ROOT Geometry 
-------------------------

Once a geometry is imported in ROOT, it can be accessed via the ``gGeoManager``. The ``Acts::TGeoLayerBuilder``, which implements an ``Acts::ILayerBuilder``, relies on the fact that this ``gGeoManager`` is accessible, if it points to ``nullptr``, obviously no conversion is done.
The ``Acts::TGeoLayerBuilder`` can be configured to search within given parsing ranges for ``TGeoNode`` objects to be converted into ``Acts::Surface`` objects. A vector of search strings can be used for situations where multiple sensor types are used or additional objects are bound to be described. 
A dedicated ``Acts::TGeoParser`` struct is then used to select the nodes from the ROOT geometry.

Conversion of TGeoShapes to Acts::Surfaces
------------------------------------------

An automatic translation of ``TGeoShape`` objects into corresponding ``Acts::Surface`` objects with appropriate bound descriptions is done by the ``Acts::TGeoSurfaceConverter`` class. 
There is some limited freedom in re-defining the orientation of the coordinate system between ROOT and Acts which can be used to adapt local coordinate definitions on the converted objects.
This is indicated by the ``const std::string& axes`` argument of the converter.

The nomenclature/convention is the following:
 * the resulting local cartesian coordinate system must by right-handed: this is guaranteed by the fact that the third local axis is contructed as a cross product of the first two local axis
 * defining the new local axes with respect to the ``TGeo`` definition is done by naming the new axes in order, e.g. an unchanged coordinate system has the tag ``XYZ``, or ``XY*``, as the third axis is defined by the first two ones
 * flipping the direction of a axis is done by lower capital, e.g. ``yZ*`` redefines the negative y-axis of the ``TGeoMatrix`` as the (obvisouly) positive x-axis of the ``Acts::Transform3`` and redefines the positive z-axis of the ``TGeoMatrix`` as corresponding y-axis of the ``Acts::Transform3`` 

In case a translation request is malformed, a ``std::exception`` is thrown, indicating the problem.

Examples of supported ``TGeoShape`` transformations to ``Acts::Surface`` objects can be found in the ``Tests/UnitTests/Plugins/TGeo`` unit test suite, a summary of the output can be seen below.

Additionally, an option exists to split surfaces after the transformation
has taken place by adding a splitter implementation to the ``Acts::TGeoLayerBuilder``, like the ``Acts::TGeoCylinderDiscSplitter``. This can be useful to describe e.g. a cylindrical detector with tangential planar surfaces.
