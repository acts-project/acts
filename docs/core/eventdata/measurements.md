# Measurements

Measurements exist as *uncalibrated* and *calibrated* types. While
*uncalibrated* measurements are the direct output of the data formation, during
the track fit, when trajectory information (or information about the trajectory
hypothesis) is available, certain calibration steps can help to improve the
track fit quality.
