# How to make a release

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for all of our PRs. We use the common prefixes: `fix:`, `feat:`, `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`.

The next version number for a release is automatically determined from the PRs (commits) that have been merged since the last release, following semantic versioning. On top of that, release notes are automatically generated from the PR titles, using the prefixes as groups.

## Step 1: Update the release branch

:::{note}
This assumes you have a local clone of the ACTS repository at hand.
You'll also need write permissions on the upstream ACTS repository to be able to push to the `releases` branch.
:::


```console
$ git checkout releases
$ git fetch upstream # make sure you're up to date
$ git merge --no-ff upstream/main
```

At this point, your commit graph should look something like this:

```

You can now push the updated `releases` branch to the remote `releases` branch using `git push -u upstream releases`. 

On push, a CI job should run and create an additional commit on the `releases` branch, which bumps a number of version numbers. That commit is going to be the one tagged with the correct version. It doesn't hurt to make sure that commit looks right, as in it bumps to a sensible next version number.


## Step 2: Prepare milestone

By convention, we assign all open PRs and issues to the `next` milestone. When a new release is cut, all closed issues and PRs are moved over to a dedicated milestone named after the next version number. To do this, go to the *Pull Requests* view on the main repository, and click *Milestones*:

:alt: The milestones button
:::

First, create a new milestone here. Name it `vX.Y.Z`, corresponding to the next version (you can check the release CI job mentioned above to determine this. The job will also create an unreleased GitHub *release* which should have the right name).

Next, go back to the list of milestones and go to the `next` milestone, and click on *closed* to get to a list of all closed PRs and issues assigned to it:

:::{image} figures/release/next_milestone.png
:alt: The next milestone, which has a "closed" button
:::

You'll be taken to a list view which shows all closed PRs and issues assigned to the `next` milestone. On the top left there should be a checkbox allowing you to select all visible items:

:::

```{note} The checkbox will only select the items on the visible page. If there are many items, it's possible you'll have to redo this step until it has been applied to all items.
```

Towards the right there's a button called *Milestone* which allows you to select a milestone to assign. Assign all closed items to the new milestone you created above.

## Step 3: Publish release

The release CI job should have created a draft release visible in the GitHub interface. If you navigate to the list of all releases, there should be an entry for this new release. You should

1. Inspect the auto-generated release note, and see if there are any obvious mistakes here that the job might have made.
2. Check that the target commit hash, that the release will generate a tag for once published, actually corresponds to the commit on the `releases` branch that the CI job from before created.
3. Click the *Publish* button to create the release.
