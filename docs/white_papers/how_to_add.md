# How to add a white paper

The white paper collection is managed through a configuration file that
contains information on registered white papers. This configuration can be
automatically updated from GitHub by a script that will pull some meta
information like the title, authors, and abstract. It will also grab the
latest compiled PDF from the source repository that was created by a
CI job.

To get started, head over to the white paper template
[repository](https://github.com/acts-project/whitepaper-template). There
should be a button toward the top right that says *Use this template*,
which will allow you to create a copy of the template
repository into a repository of your own.

:::{tip}
You can get started by creating a whitepaper repository using the template
under your own account. However, when the document finalizes, consider
moving it into the ACTS organization (`acts-project`), which helps
management of documents.
:::

The project will immediately start building the basic default note with
dummy content using GitHub Actions. You can now clone and start making
changes to the document and compile locally. 

:::{tip}
:name: latexmk-tip
The easiest way to compile the document locally is `latexmk`. Simply running `latexmk`
in the root directory will automatically compile the source code the right
number of times. It will also run `biber` that generates the references from the
example `references.bib` file. You don't have to use `latexmk`, but it's very
convenient! The output file when using `latexmk` will be in a subfolder `build`
of the root directory.
:::

:::{tip}
The note template requires LuaLatex, which should be found in any default
LaTeX installations. `latexmk` is configured to use LuaLatex by default.

## Integrate with Overleaf

[Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) is a convenient web-based LaTeX authoring tool. It has GitHub integration ðŸŽ‰!

:align: center
:::

You can then go to the *Menu* on the top right, and click on *GitHub* in the drawer menu to pull changes from GitHub, and to push changes that you made on Overleaf!

:::{danger}
Overleaf is not particularly good at handling merge conflicts, so try not to make changes on both GitHub and Overleaf.
:::

For the document to compile without errors on Overleaf, you will have to change the compiler to LuaLatex, by going to *Menu* in the top right, and changing the *Compiler* setting:

## Template repository structure

The content of the template repository will look something like this:

```console
whitepaper-template
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tex
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.tex
â”œâ”€â”€ abstract.tex
â”œâ”€â”€ references.bib
â”œâ”€â”€ latexmkrc
â””â”€â”€ theme
    â”œâ”€â”€ acts.sty
    â””â”€â”€ logo_acts.pdf
```

- `main.tex` is the root source file for the document, and you can edit it to
changed the content of the document.

- `metadata.tex` and `abstract.tex` contain the document title, authors and
   abstract. Their content is consumed by the workflow described in
   [](#whitepaper_index_update).

   `metadata.tex` contains the two standard LaTeX commands:

   ```tex
   \title{A whitepaper about a topic}
   \author{First Author \and Second Author}
   ```

   Note how the `\author` directive is given multiple authors separated by `\and`.
   The workflow below uses the literal `\and` to separate out different authors.

   `abstract.tex` contains the **content** of the abstract only, and is loaded
   into the abstract in the `main.tex` document like:

   ```tex
   \begin{abstract}
       \input{abstract.tex}
   \end{abstract}
   ```

   :::{warning}
   While LaTeX supports arbitrary content in the abstract, the index that lives in
   the documentation only supports basic math markup.
   :::

- `references.bib` contains an example reference in standard *bibtex* format, and
  is a good place to add any additional references that you want to cite in 
  your document.

- `latexmkrc` configures `latexmk` (see [here](#latexmk-tip))

- `theme` contains the overall theme of the document. You do not typically need 
  to change anything in this folder.

(whitepaper_index_update)=
## Update the white paper overview

The white paper overview in this documentation [here](#white-paper-index) is
automatically generated using a registry file and a script, both of which are
located in the main ACTS repository under `docs`.

The registration file `docs/white_papers.toml` contains a list of all
known white papers, and also stores metadata information on the white paper. It looks something like:

```toml
[[white_papers]]
repository = "https://github.com/acts-project/whitepaper-template"

[white_papers.metadata]
authors = [ "First Author", "Second Author",]
title = "A whitepaper about a topic"
description = "This is a whitepaper example. It contains a number of example\npatterns, layouts etc.\nSimple math like $a + b = c$ or even $\\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV is supported!\n\nQuisque ullamcorper placerat ipsum. Cras nibh. Morbi vel justo vitae lacus\ntincidunt ultrices. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. In hac\nhabitasse platea dictumst. Integer tempus convallis augue. Etiam facilisis. Nunc\nelementum fermentum wisi. Aenean placerat. Ut imperdiet, enim sed gravida\nsollicitudin, felis odio placerat quam, ac pulvinar elit purus eget enim. Nunc vitae\ntortor. Proin tempus nibh sit amet nisl. Vivamus quis tortor vitae risus porta\nvehicula."
```

`[[white_papers]]` indicates a white paper entry, while `[white_papers.metadata]` is a dictionary containing the metadata for that white paper.

:::{note}
`[white_papers.metadata]` is auto-generated!
:::

To add a new white paper, simply add a new section at the bottom of the file:

```toml
[[white_papers]]
repository = "https://github.com/acts-project/another-whitepaper"
slug = "another-whitepaper"
```

Note that `slug` should be lower case, not contain spaces, and be unique.

The script `docs/white_papers.py` is used to complete the metadata information
for the white papers. To run it, you need to install the dependencies in
`docs/requirements.txt` using `pip`.

:::{tip}
It is **strongly recommended** to use a [virtual
environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for
this purpose! For example, run 

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

to create a local virtual environment, and then run the `pip` command above.
:::

You also need the `convert` executable from
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) available on your `$PATH`.  You can
then run 

```console
$ white_papers.py pull --github-token $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

which will for each white_paper listed in `white_papers.toml`

1. Download the most recent PDF of the document built by that repository's CI
2. Make a PNG of the first page of that PDF to be displayed in the documentation
3. Download `metadata.tex` and `abstract.tex` from the repository, and parse 
   them to extract the title, authors and abstract content.

:::{important}
Make sure to create a tag on GitHub before running this command! This is good
for organizational purposes, but also allows directly linking to the PDF that
is generated by the CI for that tag.
:::

Afterwards, the `white_papers.toml` should now contain updated information from
all listed white papers. The `white_papers.toml` file is used to automatically
generate a white paper index, that is then used by the regular documentation
build, which you can read more about [here](#build_docs).
