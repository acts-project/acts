// === INTRODUCTION ===
//
// This header contains tools which can be used to avoid unrealistic
// compiler optimizations in microbenchmarks, such as elimination of unused
// benchmark computations or deduplication of benchmark loops which repeat
// the same operation N times with unchanging inputs.
//
// ### WARNING ON HARDWARE OPTIMIZATIONS ###
//
// When using these tools, you must keep in mind that compiler optimizations
// are only a part of the story, and CPUs will also perform a bunch of dynamic
// optimizations on their own, including but by no means limited to...
//
// - Moving small benchmark inputs into fast caches
// - Buffering and caching small benchmark outputs
// - Instruction-level parallelization (pipelining, superscalar
//   execution...) of supposedly unrelated benchmark iterations
// - "Turbo" overclocking of CPU cores which is only sustainable in specific
//   circumstances (short-running code sections, single-core execution...)
// - Branch predictor training for specific loops and conditionals
//
// Unfortunately, there is no way to disable those hardware optimizations in
// a way which meets even basic sanity requirements:
//
// - Easily portable to all CPU models of interest
// - Fine-grained enough to target CPU optimizations which are an
//   unrealistic artifact of the microbenchmark, without also disabling
//   optimizations which will happen in realistic usage scenarios (like
//   hot code remaining resident in the CPU instruction cache)
// - Generic enough for all benchmark inputs, outputs, and code
// - Minimal impact on overall benchmark timings
//
// You will thus need to live with the fact that any microbenchmark has
// hardware bias, which is not as egregious as compiler bias (since the CPU
// can't just delete gigantic sections of the code like the compiler does)
// but still very much significant on simple benchmarks.
//
// The proper way to detect and correct this bias is not to try to write more
// clever microbenchmarks. It is to use realistic benchmarks of full app
// workloads whenever possible, and treat microbenchmarks only as a tool for
// detecting performance regressions in known-critical components and
// easily fine-tuning the performance of these components, in a manner whose
// effectiveness will later have to be checked on a more realistic benchmark.

//
// === OPTIMIZATION BARRIERS ===
//
// Mark some data as read and written in the eye of the compiler, so it can't
// optimize under the assumption that the data isn't used or does not change.
//
// The current implementation has limitations that you should bear in mind:
//
// - "clobber" data which resides in CPU registers must be flushed to memory
//   and reloaded from memory afterwards if re-used. This will increase memory
//   traffic and cache footprint in a potentially unrealistic fashion.
// - Putting this optimization barrier on every iteration of a loop will
//   prevent compiler loop optimizations like autovectorization, which is
//   generally too strong. Consider putting the barrier every N loop
//   iterations instead (and checking for various N), or at the very end of
//   the loop/benchmark if the memory traffic of storing all the end results
//   doesn't bias your benchmark too much.
// - The barrier's implementation uses a very basic subset of the GCC dialect of
//   inline assembly, which although widely supported (from a quick godbolt
//   check, in addition to GCC it works on clang, djgpp, ellcc, icc and zapcc),
//   is most notably not supported by MSVC. I have not yet found an MSVC or
//   portable equivalent which is UB-free and works even when passing in a
//   pointer to a local variable, suggestions and patches are welcome.
//
#ifdef __GNUC__

template <typename T>
inline void assumeAccessed(T&& clobber) {
  // This optimization barrier leverages the fact that inline ASM isn't smart,
  // and couldn't get smarter as the compiler would then need to be able to
  // parse and understand the side effects of arbitrary assembly statements,
  // which would be a ridiculous amount of work for compiler devs:
  //
  // - The compiler only performs trivial analysis of the assembly (e.g.
  //   number of instructions for inlining purposes), so it can't leverage the
  //   fact that it's empty to optimize out its inputs. It must assume that
  //   the assembly statements will use the declared inputs, emit the declared
  //   outputs, and read/write the contents of declared clobbers.
  // - A pointer to "clobber" is declared as an input to assembly, and the
  //   "memory" clobber allows the assembly statement to read and write memory
  //   targeted by this pointer. Therefore, the compiler must compute and
  //   write down the value of "clobber" in memory, and reload it into
  //   registers if it's used later on by the program.
  // - A volatile marker is used, therefore the compiler can't optimize out
  //   the asm statement even though from its specification it should have no
  //   program-visible side effects. It also prevents the compiler from moving
  //   the asm statement out of a loop, which would be bad... But note that it
  //   does _not_ prevent it from moving within a loop iteration.

// Run a user-provided benchmark `iteration` function that takes no argument
// in batches of `iters_per_run` iterations, for `num_runs` batches, after some
// warmup period of `warmup_time` has elapsed. Return execution statistics.
//
// The output of `iteration` is marked as read, so the compiler cannot optimize
// it out except by const-propagation (i.e. it is a function of a constexpr
// quantity). If `iteration` is a lambda which captures inputs from a higher
// scope, those are marked as written on every iteration as well, so the
// compiler cannot optimize out the iteration loop into a single iteration.
//
// Together, these precautions void the need for manually calling assumeRead and
// assumeWritten in all simple cases where the benchmark iteration function
// ingests some inputs from an outer scope and emits the output of its
// computations as a return value.
//
// We do batched runs instead of using a single iteration loop because:
// - It allows us to provide error bars on the timing measurement, which allows
//   comparing two measurements and detecting timing jitter problems emerging
//   from e.g. excessive background system activity.
// - For short-running iteration functions, it allows you to keep benchmark runs
//   much shorter than one OS scheduling quantum (typically ~1ms), which enables
//   high-precision measurements devoid of any scheduling-induced timing jitter,
//   while still aggregating as much statistics as you want via `num_runs`.
//
// For optimal timing resolution on modern x86 CPUs, you will want to tune
// `iters_per_run` so that the median run timing is around a few tens of µs:
// - The TSC CPU clock which is most likely used by your operating system's
//   high-resolution clock has an overhead of a few tens of CPU cycles, so for
//   a ~GHz CPU clock this gives you a clock-related bias and noise of ~10ns. At
//   ~10µs run times, that only contributes for 1/1000 of observed timings.
// - The main source of benchmark noise is that your operating system's
//   scheduler disturbs the program every few miliseconds. With run timings of
//   ~10µs, this disturbance affects less than 1% of data points, and is thus
//   perfectly eliminated by our outlier-robust statistics.
//
// As an extra, and unfortunately sometimes conflicting suggestion, it is
// advised to keep `iters_per_run` above 30, which is the classic rule of thumb
// for the validity of the central limit theorem. This allows you to safely
// assume that the random run timing distribution follows a roughly normal
// distribution, no matter what the actual underlying iteration timing
// probability law is, and the statistical analysis methods of
// `MicroBenchmarkResult` pervasively rely on this normality hypothesis. At
// lower `iters_per_run`, please cross-check yourself that your run timings
// follow a normal distribution, and use a statistical analysis methodology that
// is appropriate for the run timings distribution otherwise.
//
// You shouldn't usually need to adjust the number of runs and warmup time, but
// here are some guidelines for those times where you need to:
// - `num_runs` is a somewhat delicate compromise between several concerns:
//       * Quality of error bars (many runs mean more precise error bars)
//       * Outlier rejection (many runs mean better outlier rejection)
//       * Benchmark running time (many runs take longer)
//       * Handling of short-lived background disturbances (these have a higher
//         chance of occuring in longer-lived benchmarks, but if they only take
//         a small portion of the benchmark's running time, they can be taken
//         care of by outlier rejection instead of polluting the results)
// - `warmup_time` should be chosen based on the time it takes for run timings
//   to reach a steady state on your system after a benchmark starts. Here is a
//   possible measurement protocol for that:
//       * Set up a long-running benchmark (several seconds) with no warmup.
//       * Dump benchmark run timings to a file at the end of every execution.
//       * Run this benchmark a couple of times (say, 5-10x times).
//       * Plot the resulting run timing time series against their cumulated sum
//         (which is a good approximation of the elapsed time).
//       * Note after how much elapsed time the timings typically become steady.
