# Example ACTS downstream project

This project demonstrates how to use ACTS in a downstream project. ACTS is used
as an external package and is expected to be installed by the user. The project
is intentionally bare-bones. It only shows how to set up the CMake configuration
but does not implement any functionality.

**Note** This directory is not included in the regular build.
