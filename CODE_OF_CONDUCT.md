# Code Of Conduct

The ACTS project observes [CERN's Code of Conduct](https://cern.ch/codeofconduct).
Below is a plain text summary of the [official PDF](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2240689/files/BrochureCodeofConductEN.pdf?)
as of 1. April 2020. Please consult the [PDF](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2240689/files/BrochureCodeofConductEN.pdf?)
for up-to-date information.

## USING THE CODE OF CONDUCT

We encourage a culture of openness where all contributors feel free to engage in a discussion about the Code of Conduct.

If you are unsure about any aspect of the Code of Conduct, there are a number of resources you may wish to access, including your hierarchy, the Human Resources Department, the Ombud Oﬃce or the Internal Audit.

In addition, to increase understanding of how the Code of Conduct applies to practical situations, you are encouraged to consult the Code of Conduct online FAQ’s, accessible at cern.ch/codeofconduct. This website will be updated on a regular basis.

## INTRODUCTION BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL

What we do in our working lives is important, and the way we do it is equally so. This is particularly true with the diverse community we have at CERN. People from all over the world come here, bringing with them different cultures and different ways of working. This diversity is part of our strength, and it’s something that we need to nurture constantly. That’s why CERN has developed a Code of Conduct that is built on a set of core CERN values, defined following broad consultation by the HR Department across the Organization in order to determine the values that underline the spirit of CERN.

Those values are integrity, commitment, professionalism, creativity and diversity. Taken together, they provide the basis for respect: respect for others, respect for the Organization and respect for its mission.

The Code of Conduct is the blueprint for how we work together. It was launched in 2010, accompanied by an Ombud Oﬃce to provide an informal route to the resolution of potential conflicts, and to serve as an interpreter of the Code of Conduct if and when necessary. I think it is fair to say that since then CERN’s values have become a natural and inherent part of the Organisation’s working landscape.

There have been occasions where people have had to be reminded of the Code’s stipulations, but these have been rare. Rather than a tool for the Organization to use as a stick, the Code is a tool for all of us to use as a guide.

Our Code of Conduct sets out in black and white the basic standards and rules of behaviour that we can expect to find in the workplace, and it provides guidance on how our actions may influence and support the good reputation of CERN. It is there to ensure that we pursue our mission of research, innovation, training and collaboration while respecting the highest ethical standards of behaviour.

It is not an exhaustive list of dos and don’ts. Rather, it is a practical guide, assisting us in understanding the consequences of how we treat others, how can we expect to be treated in the workplace, and how we should behave as ambassadors for CERN and for particle physics. It serves to help us maintain and develop a workplace marked by mutual respect.

Nurturing respect generates self-respect, and a respectful workplace is one where everyone can give their best in a supportive, collaborative, and pleasant environment.
